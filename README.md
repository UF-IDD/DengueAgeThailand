This repository includes the data and scripts for the analysis of the manuscript entitled, 
*Assessing the role of multiple mechanisms increasing the age of dengue cases in Thailand*.

- `04-dataForStan` Dataset and its data configuration
- `__main__.sh` is the entry point to all scripts used to perform the analyses

As the model fitting was computationally expensive, we also provide here diagnostics and summaries of the results in `06-assessFits`.
Plots generated from the series of scripts are also provided (see `04-describeData`, `07-inferenceFromFits`, and `10-demogTransitionEffects`).
